## Web Login

### INFO

- File explorer which checks cookies for authentication.

- Shows file listing on home page with last mod, but cant access before login.

- There are 2 users, "admin" and "test" (which you learn about through html comments)

- Receive endpoint for flagbot.

### CHECKER

1. tries to access file without login
2. then login and access file.

### ATTACK

1. cookies are generated from the username to prevent collisions (hahah) so we know cookie and can access the flag file
2. rename function only checks on client side, so we can send a request to rename our user to admin
and login

### DEFENSE

1. change cookie generation to sha256 or just something else since only one user
2. send bare request to rename test user to admin, which prevents rename,
    but sends the wrong admin cookie back



-----
GTG BED

1. session cookie value is generated based on seed time (show last login on users page)
2. check pass allows login if you change user to "../something" and then set password to its contents (use of dummy file shoppinglist), which overwrites session (use that to login as admin)
3. 


TODO:
- add endpoint to upload a note (for unregistered users)
- checker uploads a note like : "flag-RANDOM"
